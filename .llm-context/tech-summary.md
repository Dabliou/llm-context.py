LLM Context is a Python tool designed to streamline the process of sharing code context with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides functionality for selecting, formatting, and copying relevant code snippets and project structure information.

Key architectural decisions:
1. Modular design: The project is structured into separate modules (e.g., file_selector, context_generator, template_processor) to promote separation of concerns and maintainability.

2. Configuration management: A ConfigManager class handles both project-wide and user-specific configurations, supporting flexible customization.

3. Template-based output: Jinja2 templating is used for formatting output, allowing for easy customization of the generated context.

4. GitIgnore-style pattern matching: The project uses the pathspec library to implement .gitignore-style file exclusion patterns, ensuring consistency with common developer workflows.

5. Command-line interface: The tool is designed as a set of CLI commands, making it easy to integrate into existing development workflows.

Noteworthy development practices:
- The project extensively uses class methods (e.g., `create()`) for object instantiation, promoting a cleaner API and easier testing.
- Type hints are used throughout the codebase, enhancing readability and enabling static type checking.

Performance considerations:
- The file selection process is optimized to traverse directories efficiently, respecting ignore patterns at each level.

Current limitations:
- The tool is primarily designed for local filesystem operations and may not support remote or cloud-based project structures.

Unique aspects:
- The project incorporates a custom implementation of .gitignore semantics (GitIgnorer class) that respects nested .gitignore files within a project structure.

This summary provides an overview of the project's architecture and design philosophy. Maintainers should update this summary when significant architectural changes are made to the project.
