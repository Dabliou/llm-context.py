When writing Python code, prefer a functional and Pythonic style. Use list comprehensions instead of traditional for loops where appropriate. Leverage conditional expressions and single-pass operations for efficiency. Employ expressive naming and type hinting to enhance code clarity. Prefer stateless methods and concise boolean logic where possible. Make use of Python idioms such as tuple unpacking. This approach often results in more readable, maintainable, and efficient code.
