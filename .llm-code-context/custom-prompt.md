6. Keep performance considerations in mind when suggesting solutions.
7. Always consider how changes might affect existing tests and suggest new test cases when appropriate, in line with our testing approach.
8. Assume we're using Git for version control. When suggesting multi-step changes, consider how these might be broken into commits.
9. If changes might affect project documentation, please mention this.
10. If you're unsure about how a change might affect other parts of the system not visible in the current context, please say so.

## Programming Style

When writing Python code, prefer a functional and Pythonic style. Use list comprehensions instead of traditional for loops where appropriate. Leverage conditional expressions and single-pass operations for efficiency. Employ expressive naming and type hinting to enhance code clarity. Prefer stateless methods and concise boolean logic where possible. Make use of Python idioms such as tuple unpacking. This approach often results in more readable, maintainable, and efficient code.
